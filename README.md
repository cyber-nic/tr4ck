# Tr4ck

Tr4ck is designed to help software development teams identify, track, and manage technical debt within their codebases. Tr4ck provides automated scanning, real-time insights, and actionable reports to ensure that technical debt is managed effectively, improving overall code quality and maintainability.

# Overview

Tr4ck is built to seamlessly integrate into your development workflow, providing continuous monitoring and actionable insights into your codebase's health. It supports multiple programming languages and provides customizable rule sets to adapt to your project's specific needs.

# Features

## Automated Scanning

Tr4ck integrates with your VCS to automatically scan for technical debt issues upon code commits, pull requests, and merges. It utilizes static code analysis tools to identify potential problems and categorizes them based on severity and impact.

## Keyword Detection

Our application can scan for specific keywords within code comments and documentation, such as "technical debt" or "Tr4ck". This helps in identifying and tracking known issues that have been documented by developers.

## Reporting and Dashboards

Detailed reports are generated for every scan, providing insights into the types and locations of technical debt. The dashboard offers a high-level overview and allows for drilling down into specific issues.

# CI/CD Integration

Tr4ck integrates with popular CI/CD tools to ensure continuous monitoring. It can enforce quality gates to prevent the accumulation of technical debt by failing builds that exceed predefined thresholds.

# Notification System

Stay informed with notifications sent via email, Slack, or integrated project management tools. Notifications can be configured based on severity levels and types of issues detected.
